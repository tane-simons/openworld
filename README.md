# Description of Project
## Goal
The creation of a urban design and city building game

## Management
In terms of management there is no management. For things like the blending board please add things that would be valuable to the game (ideally make them yourself but yk)

## 5 Year Plan
1) Basic working city builder prototype
2) Terrain integration (yes this is a separate step, we first want working flat)
3) Political stakeholder management aspect?
4) Political system?
5) 5th year idk

## Current Stage Roadmap for Programming (he's kind of got like a ten step program)
1) Road builder
   - Creating the algorithm for generating curved roads based on user input and artist parameters for designed road types
3) Property Builder
   - Creating the algorithm for placing buildings on general shaped plots defined by the user (simple polygons or curved edges along roads)
4) Traffic Networking
   - Defining a road network via graph theory and creating the infrastructure for generating traffic point plots to use later for economic demand
   - Bidirectional roads (greater player control, more complicated)
   - traffic controllers (traffic lights, stop signs, speed limits)
5) Economy
   - Creating the economic system - goods/services market - assigning 'stores' (registers of goods stored at given plot) for each plot and consumption demands (registers for goods consumed at this plot)
   - Ordering system to respond to supply and demand. For residential this will instantiate a road network routing procedure for resident, for a business, a logistic (say truck) service will be ordered and two routes from logistic depo to supply to demand (then a return trip so 3 routes)
6) Construction
   - Adapting the logistic system and economic system for simulating construction of new buildings
